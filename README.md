# R_Hypsometry
R_Script to calculate the Hypsometric Integral from QGIS' Hypsometric Curves

To start using this script you need a folder with the .csv files of the hypsometric curves of the basins you want to analyse. You can generate these with the "Hypsometric curves" tool included in QGIS (I used version 3.16) leave the checkbox "Use % of area instead of absolute value" unchecked.

From there on you can use these csv files as your data input
